                                <h3>What is Gift Card &amp; How does it work?</h3>
                                <p>E-Gift cards stand for electronic gift cards. This means you wonâ€™t have a physical
                                    gift card when
                                    you buy an E-Gift card. Instead you will typically be emailed an E-Gift card number
                                    or bar code
                                    when you purchase from sites like Zeek, Amazon or cardpool. If you have ever looked
                                    at a
                                    traditional physical gift card, you have probably noticed the string of numbers.
                                    These numbers
                                    are the exact same as the numbers you will get for your E-Gift card. Advancements in
                                    technology
                                    have just made it so that we can step away from being forced to have a physical card
                                    to
                                    swipe.</p>
                                <p>When you are shopping you will use your E-Gift card the same way as you would a
                                    traditional gift
                                    card. If you are making a purchase online, simply enter the code in the appropriate
                                    field, the
                                    same way you would if you had the physical card sitting in front of you. If you are
                                    in a store,
                                    you can ask the salesperson to either scan the barcode or show them your E-Gift Card
                                    number from
                                    your email.</p>
